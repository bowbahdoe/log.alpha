# log.alpha

## Welcome!

This repo only contains the draft API for experimentation. That is, no backing implementation.

The rest of the in-progress components can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/bowbahdoe/log). If you want to
do any experimentation in writing publishers or to help me fill out the publisher system, that is the place.

If you just want to try out the API or maybe do your own thing you can currently snag it from jitpack. Maven Central
publishing can be done upon request.
